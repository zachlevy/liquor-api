# Liquor API
The code runs an API server as an intermediary between the [LCBO API](https://lcboapi.com/) and a liquor CRM. It essentially stores historical data. The API is RESTful.

### Run Tests with rspec and Factory Girl
```
$ bundle exec rspec
```

### Run Server on Alternate Port
```
$ rails s -p 3001
```
